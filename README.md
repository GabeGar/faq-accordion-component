## My process

### Built with

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   CSS custom properties

### What I learned

-   Positioning w/ position: (insert property value here) - was a little bit tricky for me, as I hadn't done it in a while. Served as a great refresher and reminded me, why it's an area of much needed improvement, on my end.

-   Reinforced conditional rendering, utilizing react. I'm aware of how to do it without javascript but wanted to implement the
    functionality of the according, in react, for more practice.

### Continued development

-   I struggled quite a bit with positioning the images in this project. Definitely need to work on this some more going forwards.

### Useful resources

-   [Blog by Thomas Sameshima](https://medium.com/@thomas.sameshima/css-overriding-the-parents-overflow-hidden-90c75a0e7296)
    -   Single handedly helped me overcome the positioning problem, where the desktop-box (containing the @ marking), wouldn't play nice with the overflow hidden property. Switched it to position sticky over absolute and got the job done.
